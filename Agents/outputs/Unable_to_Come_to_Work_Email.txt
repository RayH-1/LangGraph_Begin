Subject: Unable to Come to Work

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing to inform you that I am unable to make it to work today. As I mentioned in person before, I am unable to attend due to an appointment. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

Please feel free to assign any urgent tasks or responsibilities to Vibhav in my absence.

Thank you,

Ray
